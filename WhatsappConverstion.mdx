WhatsApp API categorizes conversations into different types, each serving a specific purpose. Below is a brief overview of these categories:

#### 1. **Marketing**

Marketing messages are promotional in nature and are used to engage customers with updates about products, offers, or events. However, sending marketing messages requires prior user consent.

#### 2. **Service**

Service messages include customer support and service-related inquiries. These messages help businesses respond to customer questions, provide assistance, and follow up on issues.

#### 3. **Authentication**

Authentication messages are used to verify a user's identity. These often include one-time passwords (OTPs) or confirmation codes necessary for secure logins and transactions.

#### 4. **Utility**

Utility messages provide essential service-related information that users have opted into. Examples include reminders, alerts, service updates, appointment confirmations, and delivery notifications.

Each category follows specific rules regarding message types and user consent. Understanding these categories ensures businesses communicate effectively while complying with WhatsAppâ€™s policies.
