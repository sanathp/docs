description: "Here are two methods to integrate your WordPress Contact Form 7 (CF7) form with the webhook."
---

**Method 1: Using functions.php (Recommended for Developers)**

This method sends form data to the webhook whenever the form is submitted.

### **Steps:**

1. Go to **WordPress Dashboard** → **Appearance** → **Theme File Editor**.
2. Open the **functions.php** file.
3. Copy and paste the following code at the bottom:

php

CopyEdit

`add_action('wpcf7_mail_sent', 'send_cf7_data_to_webhook'`);

`function send_cf7_data_to_webhook($contact_form`) {
`    $submission = WPCF7_Submission::get_instance`();
`    if (!$submission`) {
`        return`;
    }

`    $data = $submission->get_posted_data`();

`    // Prepare the payload`
`    $payload = json_encode`([
`        'name' => sanitize_text_field($data['your-name'`]),  
`        'phoneNumber' => sanitize_text_field($data['your-phone'`]),  
`        'email' => sanitize_email($data['your-email'`]),  
`        'projectId' => sanitize_text_field($data['your-project'`]),  
`        'message' => sanitize_textarea_field($data['your-message'`])  
    ]);

`    // Webhook URL`
`    $url = "https://server.wylto.com/integration/webhook/H3qhsWmrHfTjc5cwjRWs"`;

`    // Arguments for wp_remote_post`
`    $args` = [
`        'body' => $payload`,
`        'headers' => ['Content-Type' => 'application/json'`],
`        'method' => 'POST'`
    ];

`    // Send data to the webhook`
`    wp_remote_post($url, $args`);
}

### **How It Works**

- This code **captures form submissions** and sends them as a **JSON payload** to your webhook.
- You need to **replace** field names (`your-name`, `your-phone`, etc.) with the actual names from your CF7 form.
- Save and test your form.

## **Method 2: Using the "CF7 to Webhook" Plugin (No Coding)**

If you prefer a plugin-based method, follow these steps:

### **Steps:**

1. **Install "CF7 to Webhook" Plugin**
   - Go to **WordPress Dashboard** → **Plugins** → **Add New**.
   - Search for **"CF7 to Webhook"**, install, and activate it.
2. **Set Up the Webhook**
   - Navigate to **Contact** → **Webhook**.
   - Click on the CF7 form you want to integrate.
   - In the **Webhook URL**, enter:

     ruby

     CopyEdit

     [`https://server.wylto.com/integration/webhook/H3qhsWmrHfTjc5cwjRWs`](https://server.wylto.com/integration/webhook/H3qhsWmrHfTjc5cwjRWs)
   - Set the **Request Method** to `POST`.
3. **Map the Form Fields**
   - Add the fields manually as key-value pairs:

     ini

     CopyEdit

     `name` = [your-name]

     `phoneNumber` = [your-phone]

     `email` = [your-email]

     `projectId` = [your-project]

     `message` = [your-message]
   - Save the settings.

### **How It Works**

- The plugin automatically sends form data to the webhook after submission.
- No coding is required.
